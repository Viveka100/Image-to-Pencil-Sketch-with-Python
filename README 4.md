3)Image to Pencil Sketch with Python:

We need to read the image in RBG format and then convert it to a grayscale image. This will turn an image into a classic black and white photo. Then the next thing to do is invert the grayscale image also called negative image, this will be our inverted grayscale image. Inversion can be used to enhance details. Then we can finally create the pencil sketch by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image. This can be done by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image. Since images are just arrays, we can easily do this programmatically using the divide function from the cv2 library in Python.


In this data science project, the goal is to develop a Python-based application that can transform a regular image into a pencil sketch. This project combines elements of computer vision and image processing to achieve the desired effect. Here are the key components of the project:

Data Collection: Collect a dataset of diverse images that will be used for testing and training. These images can include various scenes, objects, and textures.

Image Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the input images. This may involve resizing, noise reduction, and contrast adjustment to improve the quality of the final sketch.

Image to Gray: Convert the input image to grayscale. This step simplifies the image and makes it easier to apply pencil sketch effects.

Invert Image: Invert the grayscale image to obtain a negative image. This step is crucial for achieving the pencil sketch effect.

Blur Image: Apply a Gaussian blur to the negative image. This blurring simulates the blending of pencil strokes and gives the sketch a smoother appearance.

Blend Images: Combine the grayscale image and the blurred negative image to create the final pencil sketch. This step involves adjusting the blending mode and opacity to achieve the desired result.

Output Generation: Save the generated pencil sketch as an image file.

User Interface (Optional): Create a user-friendly interface for users to upload their images and generate pencil sketches easily.

Evaluation: Assess the quality of the generated sketches using metrics like Structural Similarity Index (SSI) or Mean Squared Error (MSE) to ensure the sketches resemble hand-drawn pencil sketches.

Deployment: If applicable, deploy the application as a web or mobile app to make it accessible to a wider audience.

Tools and Libraries:

Python
OpenCV for image processing
NumPy for numerical operations
Matplotlib for visualization
Flask or Django for web application (if needed)
Expected Outcome:
The project will result in a Python-based application that can take any input image and convert it into a convincing pencil sketch. Users can upload their photos, and the application will produce a pencil sketch version of the image.
